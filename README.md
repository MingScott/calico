# Calico

Calico is a web engine developed for use with inkle's narrative scripting language Ink.

This project has an itch page [here](https://elliotherriman.itch.io/calico).

Due to browser security issues, you may need to use [Catmint](https://elliotherriman.itch.io/catmint), or run a local server if you know how, in order to test your game. These issues won't be present once your game is uploaded to a website like itch.io.

If you're interested in contributing, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request.

Calico and all patches are released under the MIT license. Additionally, a small number of patches rely on other MIT licensed code. At runtime, Calico will automatically generate and compactly print all necessary licenses to the browser console.
